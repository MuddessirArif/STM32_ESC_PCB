# Dual ESC System ‚Äì STM32L431-Based Motor Controller

This project presents a dual Electronic Speed Controller (ESC) system designed around the STM32L431KC microcontroller. Each ESC channel is capable of independently driving a three-phase brushless motor, with integrated current sensing, voltage monitoring, and dedicated gate drivers for precise and reliable motor control.

## üìò Overview

The design includes two identical ESC channels. Each channel consists of:

- **STM32L431KC Microcontroller**  
  Responsible for control logic, PWM generation, and real-time processing of feedback data.

- **FD6288 Gate Driver**  
  High-speed 3-phase driver IC for controlling the motor power MOSFETs.

- **Phase Outputs (A, B, C)**  
  Three-phase half-bridge outputs connected to the brushless motor.

- **Current Sense Circuit**  
  Provides phase current feedback for protection and closed-loop control.

- **Voltage & Current Monitor**  
  Supplies operating feedback to the MCU for performance tuning and fault detection.

- **Motor Pad**  
  Terminal block for connecting each brushless DC motor.

- **Battery Pad**  
  Power input terminal for each ESC unit.

Each ESC also includes a dedicated **SWD (Serial Wire Debug)** interface for firmware programming and debugging.

## üîã Power Section

The system includes onboard voltage regulation for multiple power domains:

- **3.3V** ‚Äì Logic supply for MCU and sensors  
- **5V** ‚Äì Peripherals and I/O  
- **8.4V** ‚Äì Intermediate voltage rail  
- **12V** ‚Äì Power stage / gate drive circuitry

Power rails are isolated and filtered to ensure stability and to protect control logic from switching noise introduced by the motor stages.
