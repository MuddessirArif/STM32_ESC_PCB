Dual ESC System â€“ STM32L431-Based Motor Controller

This document describes the schematic design for a dual Electronic Speed Controller (ESC) system based on the STM32L431KC microcontroller. 
Each ESC is capable of driving a three-phase brushless motor with current sensing, voltage monitoring, and dedicated gate drivers.

________________________________________

Overview

The design is split into two identical ESC channels, each consisting of the following:

â€¢	STM32L431KC
  Microcontroller responsible for control logic, PWM generation, and feedback processing.

â€¢	FD6288 Gate Driver
  Drives the power MOSFETs for each motor phase (A, B, and C).

â€¢	Phase Outputs
  Three-phase H-bridge output stages for motor control.

â€¢	Current Sense Circuit
  Measures motor phase current for protection and closed-loop control.

â€¢	Voltage & Current Monitor
  Provides operating feedback to the microcontroller for safety and performance tuning.

â€¢	Motor Pad
  Connection point to the motor.

â€¢	Battery Pad
  Power input for each ESC.

Each ESC also includes a debug interface using the standard SWD protocol for firmware development and system diagnostics.

Power Section

The system includes onboard power regulation for:

  â€¢	3.3V
  â€¢	5V
  â€¢	8.4V
  â€¢	12V

Power is isolated and distributed between control and drive logic, ensuring clean and stable operation across the system.
