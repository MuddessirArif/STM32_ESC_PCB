# Dual ESC System â€“ STM32L431-Based Motor Controller

This repository contains the schematic design for a dual Electronic Speed Controller (ESC) system built around the STM32L431KC microcontroller. Each ESC unit is capable of driving a three-phase brushless motor with current sensing, voltage monitoring, and dedicated gate drivers.

## Overview

The design is split into two identical ESC channels, each containing:

- **STM32L431KC**: Main microcontroller responsible for control logic, PWM generation, and feedback processing.
- **FD6288 Gate Driver**: Drives the power MOSFETs for each motor phase (A, B, and C).
- **Phase Outputs**: Three-phase H-bridge output stages for motor control.
- **Current Sense Circuit**: Measures motor phase current for protection and closed-loop control.
- **Voltage & Current Monitor**: Feeds key operating data to the MCU for fault handling and performance optimization.
- **Motor Pad**: Output connection to the BLDC motor.
- **Battery Pad**: Input connection for power supply.

Each ESC includes a **debug interface** for firmware development and system diagnostics using standard SWD tools.

## Power Section

The system features onboard regulation for:

- **3.3V, 5V, 8.4V, and 12V** outputs
- Independent power rails for control and drive logic
- Modular layout for clean signal separation

## Applications

This dual ESC design is intended for drone propulsion systems, robotic platforms, or any multi-motor setup requiring precise, reliable control with integrated protection features.
