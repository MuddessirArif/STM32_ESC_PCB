# Dual ESC System â€“ STM32L431-Based Motor Controller

This repository contains the complete schematic design for a dual-channel Electronic Speed Controller (ESC) system based on the **STM32L431KC** microcontroller. Each ESC unit is designed to drive a three-phase brushless DC motor with precise control, real-time current sensing, and reliable protection features.

## Overview

The system consists of two identical ESC channels, each including:

- **STM32L431KC** â€“ Microcontroller for control logic, PWM generation, and feedback processing.
- **FD6288 Gate Driver** â€“ Drives MOSFETs to control the three motor phases (A, B, and C).
- **Phase Outputs** â€“ H-bridge power stage for three-phase BLDC motor control.
- **Current Sense Circuit** â€“ Monitors motor current for protection and closed-loop operation.
- **Voltage & Current Monitor** â€“ Provides real-time feedback for safe and efficient motor control.
- **Motor Pad** â€“ Interface to connect the motor windings.
- **Battery Pad** â€“ Power input for each ESC unit.
- **Debug Interface** â€“ SWD interface for firmware development and system debugging.

## Power Section

The power management section generates the following regulated outputs:

- **3.3V**
- **5V**
- **8.4V**
- **12V**

These power rails are isolated and distributed to logic and power components to ensure stability and reliability.

## Applications

- Drones (multirotor propulsion)
- Robotics and automation
- Electric mobility solutions
- Multi-motor control systems
